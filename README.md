## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!
- For the creation Process, I had to learn the Kotlin programming language on CodeAcademy in order to than make changes to the overall project. In order to implement the bio Photo I had to add the photo to the "res > drawable directory" to than programmatically add that image on the file named "MainActivity.kt"(in order to find the file i hod to do double shift and search the file). Once on "MainActivity.kt", I changed the code block of the function "configureImage" and select the correct image i uploaded. For the **Theme** I used the "colors.xml" that was already created, and also by creating a file named "styles.xml" on "main > res > values" where i added my theme for the app. Than in order to set the theme i had to use the file named "AndroidManifest.xml" and change to this "android:theme="@style/BryanTheme" inside the <application>.
